📖 Project Description

This project is an interactive Queue Data Structure Visualizer created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It demonstrates how different queue operations work through animations and real-time UI updates.

The system supports multiple queue types, allowing the user to understand the behavior and differences between:

Linear Queue

Circular Queue

Priority Queue

Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Help users understand queue operations visually

Demonstrate data structure behavior using animations

Provide an interactive tool for learning FIFO concepts

Implement queue operations using JavaScript arrays

Show differences between common queue types

⚙️ Features Implemented
✔ Queue Operations

Enqueue

Dequeue

Enqueue from Front (Deque)

Dequeue from Rear (Deque)

✔ Additional Features

Set Maximum Queue Size

Auto Fill Sample Values

Reset Queue

Animated visualization

Sound effects for operations

Live display of front index, rear index, and current size

🛠 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure & layout

CSS3 – Styling & animations

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic, queue operations, dynamic updates

Web Audio API – Sound feedback

🧠 How to Use

Open index.html in any browser.

Select a queue type:

Linear Queue

Circular Queue

Priority Queue

Deque

Perform operations using the buttons:

Enqueue

Dequeue

Auto Fill

Reset

Observe real-time animations and queue index indicators.

📌 Learning Outcome

From this project, the following concepts are demonstrated:

FIFO (First In First Out) behavior

Real-time queue operation flow

Differences between queue variants

Basic animation and DOM manipulation in JavaScript

Practical implementation of data structures in UI form

📜 Conclusion

This Queue Visualization project successfully shows how queue operations work in a simple, interactive, and visually understandable manner.
It is useful for students, beginners, and anyone learning basic data structures
